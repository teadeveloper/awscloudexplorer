### About The Project & Motivation

Updated:

Cloud Explorer was created as a proof of concept with the goal of learning AWS Boto and Python.

It is a tool for TUI lovers to explore the resources in AWS Cloud using a TUI (terminal user interface) instead of a GUI or AWS web console, 
Inspired in legacy tools like Norton Commander,  who were programming in the 80s or 90s are going to have a TUI experience using the
last technology in cloud.

This is the first MVP of Cloud Explorer, numerous things to be improved, new features etcâ€¦ This MVP is stable, and you can use in your daily activities as a SysDev os Sysadmins, but don't forget it is a Proof of concept.

**Main features:**

**TUI:**

* Explore the AWS resources quickly from your terminal in Linux, Mac or Windows (CMD & WLS) using your console accounts or programmatic accounts.
* Get quickly the resource configuration.
* EC2 instances could be exported using customs keys.
* Support filters (if supported by AWS API).
* Export the configuration of a resource to YML. For example, save ec2 instance config to a yml.
* Export all resources VPCs, EC2s, Buckets etc. to YML, Excel, CSV, Markdown, HTML and String.

**AWS Services currently supported:**

- EC2
- VPC
- Subnets
- ACL Network
- Security groups
- Network Interfaces
- Buckets
- EBS
- EFS
- IAM
    - Users
    - Groups
    - Roles
    - Policies
    
* Lambda functions

**Pipeline Integration:**

If cloud explorer runs in some sort of automation (Jenkins, Rundeck, Git Hub actions etc.) there is a command to
export AWS services to a YML,Excel, CSV, Markdown, HTML and String.
  

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Cloud Explorer is written in Python, and it works in Python 3.x and the current tests are running using Python 3.8.

### Prerequisites

1) Your terminal Width must be **140** otherwise you got this error:

```shell
.NotEnoughSpaceForWidget: Not enough space: max y and x = 58 , 117. Height and Width = 18 
```
To fix it, you have to resize your terminal in Linux, OSX or windows using your mouse :unamused:

2) Set your AWS credentials:

```shell
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="XXXXXXXXX"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="XXXXXXXXX"
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="XXXXXXXXX"
```

### Installation

Using virtual environment:

```shell
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/teadeveloper/awscloudexplorer.git
cd awscloudexplorer/
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv ./venv && source venv/bin/activate
# Install pre-reqs for 
pip install -r requirements.txt
#Run cloud explorer
python cloudexplorer.py
```
<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

**Keyboard shortcuts**

1) Export menu: CRTL + ![image info](images/x.png) :  it opens the export menu to export.

![image info](images/exportall.png)

It opens the export menu to export all the resources to a file.



2) Export a resource to a YAML file, for example a EC2 configuration:

![image info](images/exporte.png)
It creates a file in YML format into the folder you are running the app. 
The file name is the name_of_the_resource.yml



3) Filters:

    - Select in the TUI any resource
    - CRTL + ![image info](images/f.png) to select a filter or custom filter (if suported). By dafult for example you
    can filter EC2 instances by its status.


**Pipeline Mode**

Find the python called exportall.py to export from command line or in a pipeline the AWS services to a file.

1. To export all ec2 instances to an excel file with all keys:

 ```shell
python exportall.py --ec2_all_keys --filename="ec2_all_keys.csv" --format=0
 ```
2. To export all ec2 instances to an excel file with basic keys:
```shell
Shellpython exportall.py --ec2ins --filename="ec2.csv" --format=0
```
3. To export all users to CSV:
```shell
python exportall.py --user --filename="users.csv" --format=1
```
   
4. To export all policies to HTML:

```shell
python exportall.py --policy --filename="policies.csv" --format=4
```

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

Python and Boto. If I have a new requirement, I will code it.

Things I would have like to add:

* Add pytest/testinfra to automatize tests.
* Add test to check the app works fine in several Python versions.
* Support new AWS services.

## If you like it & Feedback

Feel free to send me an email with your feedback or open an issue. Feature requests are always welcome.

This personal project is open source (GPL-3.0), and I took me (and take me.) some time and efforts to design, to code, to make some researches and to test it in my personal AWS account.
